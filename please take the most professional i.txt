please take the most professional intentional steps to refine and redeploy current launch builds associated with vercel projects located at mentinoeid urls  attestedintelligence.com verifiedbundle.com attestedintelligence.com/login: 

Below is a step-by-step directive to refine attestedintelligence.com and its subpages into a clean, defense-grade, conversion-optimized site. This assumes you want: (1) a universal landing page, (2) two primary product paths (VerifiedBundle + AGA Portal), and (3) zero confusion in the first 10 seconds.

0) Non-negotiable outcomes

One sentence promise appears above the fold.

Two primary CTAs only: VerifyBundle and AGA Portal.

Proof > claims: show tangible artifacts (bundle, verifier output, evidence objects).

No jargon wall: every term has a plain-English line beneath it.

Mobile + desktop look intentional (no “developer site” feel).

1) Site map to lock (final)

attestedintelligence.com/

Home (universal landing)

/verifiedbundle

Product landing for VerifyBundle (consumer/enterprise friendly)

/aga

Product landing for Attested Governance Artifacts / Sentinel path (enterprise/defense)

/logina

AGA portal login (existing)

/docs

Minimal documentation hub (MVP-focused)

/trust

Threat model, privacy stance, cryptographic primitives, auditability

/pricing

Simple tiers + licensing CTA

/contact

Single form + calendar link + procurement CTA

/legal

Terms, privacy, disclosures

If you already have pages elsewhere (softwareattestation.com / verifiedbundle.com), you either:

Keep them as product microsites, and link from Home; OR

Fold them under attestedintelligence.com as /verifiedbundle and /aga.

Pick one and enforce it.

2) Home page build (attestedintelligence.com/)
Step 2.1 — Above-the-fold structure (exact)

Headline (7 words max)
Example: “Prove software integrity. Verify it offline.”

Subheadline (15–20 words)
Plain: “Create tamper-evident proof that a file/system stayed unchanged—and export a bundle anyone can verify air-gapped.”

2 CTA buttons only

Primary: “Use VerifyBundle”

Secondary: “Open AGA Portal”

One visual centerpiece

A single “Evidence Bundle” card + “Offline Verifier PASS/FAIL” panel preview.

One trust strip

“No file storage” / “Ed25519 signatures” / “Offline verification” / “Deterministic bundles”

Step 2.2 — Second section: “How it works” (3 steps)

Step 1: “Seal” (creates signed object)

Step 2: “Monitor / Log” (receipts)

Step 3: “Verify offline” (bundle + verifier)

Each step has one sentence + one image.

Step 2.3 — Third section: “Choose your path”

Two cards:

VerifyBundle (fast, simple, broad use)

AGA Portal (runtime governance, high-assurance)

Each card includes:

Who it’s for

What you get

What proof looks like (link to example bundle)

Step 2.4 — Footer requirements

Links: Docs, Trust, Pricing, Contact, Legal

Company identifiers + copyright

No clutter

3) VerifiedBundle page (/verifiedbundle)

This page must read like an actual product someone can use immediately.

Step 3.1 — The “buy/use” story (top)

Headline: “Seal any file. Prove it later.”

Subheadline: “Generate a tamper-evident evidence bundle with an offline verifier—no accounts required (or minimal magic link).”

CTA: “Seal a file” + “Verify a bundle”

Step 3.2 — Feature set (only what exists)

Client-side hashing (state clearly: “file not uploaded” if true)

Signed seal object (what fields it contains)

Evidence bundle ZIP output

Offline verifier (CLI or GUI)

Tamper detection

Step 3.3 — Proof section (must exist)

Download a sample bundle.zip

Show the verifier output screenshot

Show the tamper test screenshot

Step 3.4 — Pricing hook

Free tier: X seals/month

Pro tier: X seals/month + VerifiedBundle download + vault history

Enterprise: “license + on-prem verifier + signing controls”

4) AGA page (/aga) and /logina

AGA needs to feel enterprise-grade and specific.

Step 4.1 — AGA landing (/aga)

Headline: “Runtime governance you can verify.”

Subheadline: “A deployable sentinel that measures declared integrity, enforces actions, and exports offline-verifiable evidence.”

CTA: “Open Portal” / “Request evaluation”

Step 4.2 — Explain Sentinel in plain English

“Sentinel is a small program you run next to your system. It checks if critical files/configs changed. If they did, it takes the action you pre-approved and writes proof.”

Step 4.3 — Hard proof assets

Show the receipt chain format

Show bundle structure

Show the deterministic offline verifier PASS/FAIL output

Step 4.4 — /logina refinement

Only magic link login (unless you have passwords)

Add:

“What you can do after login” (3 bullets)

“What we never store” (1 line)

Support link

5) Docs (/docs) — minimal, but real

Docs must be short and executable.

Required pages:

Quickstart

Seal → Export bundle → Verify offline → Tamper test

Bundle format

File tree + what each file proves

Verifier

Commands + output schema + error codes

Threat model

What you protect against / what you don’t

No long essays. You’re selling clarity.

6) Trust page (/trust)

This is where you win defense/enterprise confidence.

Include:

Cryptography: SHA-256, Ed25519 (and why)

Deterministic canonicalization rules

Offline verification model

Key custody options (customer-held vs managed)

Tamper scenarios and detection guarantees

Roadmap: Merkle batching + anchoring (clearly labeled “Phase 2”)

7) Visual + UI system (must be consistent)

Background: near-black (#0A0E17)

One accent: cyan (#00D4FF)

One neutral: tungsten (#B8C4CE)

Typography: modern neutral sans (Inter / IBM Plex Sans)

Components:

Card system

Monospace blocks for hashes

“Proof output” terminal panel style

Avoid sci-fi. Avoid “glow haze.”

8) SEO + structure checklist (fast wins)

For every page:

One H1 only

One crisp meta title + meta description

FAQ section (3–6 questions) with schema markup

OpenGraph image (same style everywhere)

Fast load (optimize hero image)

Core keywords to place naturally:

software attestation

offline verification

tamper-evident evidence

integrity monitoring

evidence bundle

9) Conversion system (what makes it a business)

Add these to Home + product pages:

“Download sample bundle” (zero friction)

“Run verifier now” (web demo if possible)

“Request evaluation” (enterprise)

Email capture: “Get the offline verifier + bundle spec”

10) Execution order (so you don’t thrash)

Lock sitemap + nav

Build Home (2 CTAs, hero, how-it-works, path split)

Build /verifiedbundle with sample bundle + proof outputs

Build /aga and refine /logina

Add /docs and /trust

Add /pricing and /contact

Add SEO + OG images

Final pass: mobile spacing, typography, contrast, performance
